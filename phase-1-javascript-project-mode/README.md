I made this because I wanted an app that would populate with great images of superheroes and make it possible for someone to access obscure facts about their superhero of choice. As a comic book geek, I wanted to be able to look up family members of superheroes so that I could win trivia contests.

Because I needed 3 event listeners to fulfill the assignment, I embedded an alert message and a mouseover message in addition to DOMContentLoaded.

My code was inspired by Sergio Perez's "Fetching the original Pokemon using the Poke API" at https://medium.com/@sergio13prez/fetching-them-all-poke-api-62ca580981a2, the GitHub Search App in the flatiron lesson and Ashutosh Mohanty's "Dev_Hero_Superhero_Search_Engine on GitHub.

I used the Superhero API at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/akabab/superhero-api@0.3.0/api/all.json

My image of Supergirl comes from Volume 4 of Steve Orlando's "Supergirl: In Plain Sight" and can be found here: https://www.superherodb.com/pictures2/portraits/10/100/790.jpg

A video of me walking through the functionality of this app can be found on YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lAXtnUfHTQ

I also have a blog post on Medium that covers the different features of the app at: https://medium.com/@allyourbasearebelongtousmeow/superhero-api-using-foreach-and-split-a4c0368ba22
