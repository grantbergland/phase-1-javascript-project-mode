My code was inspired by Sergio Perez's "Fetching the original Pokemon using the Poke API" at https://medium.com/@sergio13prez/fetching-them-all-poke-api-62ca580981a2, the GitHub Search App in the flatiron lesson found here: https://git@github.com:grantbergland/phase-1-github-search-app.git, and Ashutosh Mohanty's "Dev_Hero_Superhero_Search_Engine on GitHub at https://git@github.com:Ashutosh102/DevHero_SuperHero_search_Engine.git

I used the Superhero API at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/akabab/superhero-api@0.3.0/api/all.json

My image of Supergirl comes from Volume 4 of Steve Orlando's "Supergirl: In Plain Sight" and can be found here: https://www.superherodb.com/pictures2/portraits/10/100/790.jpg

A video of me walking through the functionality of this app can be found on YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lAXtnUfHTQ

I also have a blog post on Medium that covers the different features of the app at: https://medium.com/@allyourbasearebelongtousmeow/superhero-api-using-foreach-and-split-a4c0368ba22

The gif of the app searching for the Barry Allen flash can be seen here: https://media.giphy.com/media/sETRlfWKbQNogECAec/giphy.gif
